# TSL Interactive 3D Visualization

A Three.js WebGPU interactive 3D visualization with cursor-responsive deformation and shader-based distortion effects in the background. Built as a learning exercise in [TSL](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/Three.js-Shading-Language#learning-tsl), originally a client demo that never shipped.

A low fidelity prototype exploring interactive shaders with halftone patterns, glitch effects, and real-time parameter control.
